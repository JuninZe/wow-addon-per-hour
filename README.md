To see how far I am from my honor items, I created this AddOn!

You will find three options:

- Start: Starts the timer whenever it is stopped.
- Pause: Pause the timer whenever it is active.
- Clear: Clear information whenever there is one.

This is an experimental project and feedbacks are welcome!
